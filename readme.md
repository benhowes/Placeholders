3D printable initialled place-holders, with space for an LED tea light in the stand. Here's a bunch of them:

#Why?

I made some for a Christmas dinner. Everyone liked them so I thought I would share.

#How?

You need a file of names and initials, such as the `initials.csv` included here, You also need:

* python
* openscad

I have only been able to test on **ubuntu linux** thus far as command line access to openscad is required.

When these dependencies have been satisfied, simply edit the CSV to contain the names and initials you need then run `python make.py` and STL's shall start appearing in the export folder.
